    Instantiation uses just one instance of all jazzService descendants, one instance of jazzServices and one instance of jazzCommons.

    All other objects do not deserve any special consideration, except that allocation must strictly follow what is in the doxygen
    documentation, basically: Allocate using JAZZALLOC() and JAZZFREE() only!

    jazzCommons
    -----------

        There is only one instance of jazzCommons at the disposition of all the modules through jazzCommons.h and implemented in
    jazzCommons.cpp. It is the global variable jCommons.

        NOTE: jazzCommons is a big object extending over jzzCONFIG, jzzACCESS, jzzTHREADS, jzzLOGGER and jzzHTTP. In all these modules
    there is obviously no need to use jCommons and it would be wrong.


    jazzServices
    ------------

        There is only one instance of jazzServices at the disposition of all the modules through jazzCommons.h and implemented in
    jazzCommons.cpp. The canonical way to access it is the global variable jServices in jazzCommons.cpp. Note that it is seldom used
    since the normal (not CATCH_TEST) instantiation of almost everything but jazzCommons is in jzzINSTANCES.


    All the jazzService descendants
    -------------------------------

        All the descendants (via jazzWebSource, jzzBLOCKS or jzzFUNCTIONAL) except jzzAPI are instantiated in jzzINSTANCES when the application runs
    normally DEBUG or NDEBUG) except under CATCH_TEST. jzzAPI is instantiated in jzzAPI.cpp since jzzAPI needs all other descendants.

        These instances are register_service()ed at the only instance of jazzServices and started globally. See the doc on main_server_start()
    for details.

        When CATCH_TEST, there is no global instantiation of all the services. Services are instantiated as required by the tests and
    typically destroyed after them.
