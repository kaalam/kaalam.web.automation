====================================================================================================================================================
    PROTOCOL VERSION  -  0.1.5  -  May 2017
====================================================================================================================================================
    PRINCIPLES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GET, HEAD and OPTIONS are SAFE methods.             => They can NEVER have side effects. Any cached (non error) represents a valid state.
GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT and DELETE are IDEMPOTENT.  => Repeating a request twice has the same effect as making it just once.
                                                       Clarification: This is applicable to the state of the backend, NOT the status returned.
                                                       E.g., A first successful DELETE returns 204, a second 404.
POST is not used.
TRACE is not used.
HEAD and OPTIONS are just created at the outermost API level and never followed into the functionality. (HEAD uses GET, OPTIONS tries parsing GET,
PUT and DELETE.)

COMPRESSION is not supported in version 1.0. In later versions this may change using content negotiation (Accept-Encoding: gzip) with Vary Header.

CACHE HEADERS are not used in the current version. This will probably change in later versions.

SECURITY is detailed in RFC security.html but still not implemented.

All block upload is done via PUT (everything is a block) with a RAW type. This is because the upload process is done in chunks and the API merges
binary blocks with unpredictable chunk lengths. After the upload is complete, the block should be hashed and converted to the appropriate type
using the block API.

====================================================================================================================================================
    TOP LEVEL:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 3 kinds of API calls: block, instrument and www.

Surprise 1! There is no functional API, a function is a block. Just like there are serializers converting numeric to anything, there are parsers
converting functions from source to a stored block. A PUT of a function source code to a block through a parser, creates the function (or fails).
A GET of the function, returns the source code, a GET though an evaluator (a function called .eval) returns the result of the function.

Surprise 2! RAMQ is transparent. There is no RAMQ API. Jazz caches results of functions but never provides cached copies without checking the
hash tree and forcing re-evaluation on any update or on cache miss.

Surprise 3! There is no steering API. Two always existent sources "sys" and "www" control Jazz steering through a GET //sys//[function]{/parameters}
or PUT //sys//[function]{/parameters} and the same with www. sys contains many blocks that are maintained by Jazz, (roles, logger, statistics, etc.)
sys is always read/written through functions. www contains dictionaries converting URIs to resources and blocks with those resources to support
the www API.

More on the www API: By calling the appropriate functions on the www source, a static (as in static resources, usually including JS interaction
with APIs) website can control the headers: Content-Language, Content-Encoding and the mime type of each resource.

Conventions:

    [*]             Mandatory string made of [a-zA-Z0-9_]+ (Source, key, function, mesh and instrument names use these characters.)
    {*}             Optional string made of [a-zA-Z0-9_]+
    {/parameters}   Optional string made of [a-zA-Z0-9_,;&%\-\.\\]+ starting with / and finishing the URI. The parameters of a function.
                    Any character can be passed as a parameter since parameters understand C escaping sequences and \ is a valid character.
                    (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C) both octal and hex sequences are acceptable.
    (anything)      Any string forming a valid URI not starting with //

    + (Upload the web source name as a raw string)

--------------------------------
"source" : any source functions
--------------------------------

GET //source.key.header                            - Get header data for the block. Returns an array of strings with names of the parameters
                                                     and the values in decimal for type, length, size and flags. hash64 is returned as hexadecimal.

GET //source.key.as_text/format                    - Returns a data block as a list of strings with a format (valid for sprintf()) string.
                                                     If the block is not a data block, it returns MHD_HTTP_NOT_ACCEPTABLE.

GET //source.key.as_R                              - Returns a data block as native R binary that can be converted with unserialize() in R.
                                                     If the block is not a data block, it returns MHD_HTTP_NOT_ACCEPTABLE.

PUT //source.key.header/type                       - Assign the type to an existing block to a compatible type. Returns '0' if ok.
    + (Upload the type as raw 32 bit int)            This function also hashes the block. All errors return MHD_HTTP_NOT_ACCEPTABLE.
                                                     This does not change the data (except the header).

PUT //source.key.from_text/type,source_key,format  - Create a block with the appropriate type from an array of strings. Returns '0' if ok.
                                                     type = destination type in block_C_BOOL .. block_C_REAL. To make this function idempotent
                                                     both blocks have different keys. The block with the strings must be uploaded first
                                                     to "source_key". "format" is a valid per row sscanf compatible format for the appropriate type.

PUT //source.key.from_R/source_key                 - Create a block with the appropriate type from a native R vector. Returns '0' if ok.
                                                     Apply to a binary R vector created with serialize() and uploaded to "source_key". It can be
                                                     logical, integer, real or character and is converted to block_C_BOOL, block_C_INTEGER,
                                                     block_C_REAL or block_C_OFFS_CHARS. The type can later be changed (to a binary compatible one)
                                                     with a PUT to //source.key.header/type just like a conversion from a raw block.
                                                     Unlike PUT //source.key.header/type this function creates a new block changing the content
                                                     of the uploaded block. To make it idempotent both blocks have different keys.

PUT //source.key.header/flags                      - Write the flags attribute of an existing block. Returns '0' if ok.
    + (Upload the flags as a raw 32 bit int)         Value to be written to flags.

PUT //source.key.C_bool_rep/x,times                - Create a block_C_BOOL by repeating a value a number of times. Returns '0' if ok.
                                                     x=0 or 1, times = length of the vector. E.g., "//src.k01.C_bool_rep/1,250"

PUT //source.key.C_integer_rep/x,times             - Create a block_C_INTEGER by repeating a value a number of times. Returns '0' if ok.
                                                     x=value, times = length of the vector. E.g., "//src.k01.C_integer_rep/5,50"

PUT //source.key.C_integer_seq/from,to,by          - Create a block_C_INTEGER using a simple sequence. Returns '0' if ok.
                                                     from (starting value), to (end value, may not be included, is the supremum), by (increment)
                                                     The increment may be negative, in that case "from" must be bigger than "to".
                                                     E.g.,"//src.k01.C_integer_seq/10,1,-2"

PUT //source.key.C_real_rep/x,times                - Create a block_C_REAL by repeating a value a number of times. Returns '0' if ok.
                                                     x=value, times = length of the vector. E.g., "//src.k01.C_real_rep/-2.5,10"

PUT //source.key.C_real_seq/from,to,by             - Create a block_C_REAL using a simple sequence. Returns '0' if ok.
                                                     from (starting value), to (end value, may not be included, is the supremum), by (increment)
                                                     The increment may be negative, in that case "from" must be bigger than "to".
                                                     E.g.,"//src.k01.C_real_seq/1,9.9,0.25"

PUT //source.key.C_chars_rep/times                 - Create a block_C_OFFS_CHARS by repeating a string a number of times. Returns '0' if ok.
