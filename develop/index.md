# Development Documentation for the Jazz Server

Jazz 0.5+ is code name for anything alive and maintained. After Jazz 0.1.7 was released under an Apache 2.0 license in December 2017.

### History:

 - Jazz 0.2.x was a successful refactor of the block logic and added a new class of containers.
 - Jazz 0.3.x & Jazz 0.4.x pivoted before a stable, complete, documented release was produced (many parts are still part of Jazz)

### Latest and in development:

 - Jazz 0.5.1 is the first complete release with all our dreams about jazz_elements implemented, documented and tested.
 - Jazz 0.5.2 is a release in progress with some API enhancements to deploy "The Tangle".
 - Jazz 0.6.1 is the project of developing Bop on a stable mature Jazz that has everything in terms of blocks, containers and communications.
