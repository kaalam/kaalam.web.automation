	THIS IS A DRAFT  -  Jazz 0.2+ uses named sources.

    Jazz's LMDB implementation has some configurable options (see rom_default/jazz_config.ini), especially for mdb_env_create() .. mdb_env_open()
    but uses a subset of the functionality. Any deviation from default values of the configuration has yet to be tested.

    Specifically:

    1.  Databases are ALWAYS named. Only LMDB uses the NULL database to keep the names of the databases. No writing to NULL or reading for other
        purposes than jzzBLOCKS::open_all_sources() is allowed.
    2.  In mdb_dbi_open() the only supported flags are: 0 (for everything except creating a new database) and MDB_CREATE for just that.
        Again, in case that wasn't clear,: Duplicated keys are forbidden & keys are strings (no one cares how they are sorted internally).
    3.  mdb_txn_begin() only uses the flag MDB_RDONLY (for reading) and 0 for writing/deleting.
    4.  Transactions are never nested.
    5.  Writing transactions are committed immediately and transactions always finish immediately.
    6.  Reading transactions return internal pointers and must be jzzBLOCKS::block_unprotect()ed asap:
            ""Because LMDB is very efficient (and usually zero-copy), the data returned in an MDB_val structure may be memory-mapped straight from
            disk. In other words look but do not touch (or free() for that matter). Once a transaction is closed, the values can no longer be used,
            so make a copy if you need to keep them after that."" -- LMDB dixit.
        Of course, the block can be jzzBLOCKS::new_block_copy()ed if there is need to keep it for a long time before jzzBLOCKS::block_unprotect().
    7.  When CATCH_TEST is defined, the database path from the configuration is changed silently and replaced by a new one just for the tests.
    8.  A Jazz source IS an LMDB dbi. Sources stored in persistence are discovered via jzzBLOCKS::open_all_sources() when jzzBLOCKS is started.
    9.  All sources have at least one block with the special key "." of type block_SourceAttributes written automatically by jzzBLOCKS::new_source()
    10. Two reserved database names are: "SYS" and "ROM".
    11. "ROM" is not really persisted. "ROM" is (READ ONLY MESHES) a functional API that retrieves data blocks, just using the same syntax as if they
        were stored. Obviously, a functional instrument possibly containing billions of records doesn't need to be stored or even computed except
        for the required elements. A JS asking for the first 50 rows of a 1 billion long instrument should only need 50 elements to be computed.
        As an LMDB dbi, "ROM" is empty. In the future it could store some parameters required by functions, if that makes sense.
    12. "SYS" contains the following blocks.

        -------------------------------------------------
                key : type
        ------------+------------------------------------
        "all_role"  : BLOCKTYPE_ALL_ROLES
        "all_kysp"  : BLOCKTYPE_ALL_KEYSPACE
        "all_crty"  : BLOCKTYPE_ALL_SECURITY
        "my_log%d"  : BLOCKTYPE_MY_LOG_EVENTS
        "my_htt%d"  : BLOCKTYPE_MY_PROFILING
        "my_crt%d"  : BLOCKTYPE_MY_SECURITY
        ------------+------------------------------------
          %d - many blocks with trailing decimal numbers
        -------------------------------------------------

        There is only one block of each "all_*" key and the foreman forces that to be equal on all nodes. All these blocks are raw images of records
        that evolve and are only valid for the current version.
    13. There is an automatic version control of SYS block types that creates the "SYS" dbi from scratch when the version changes.

    Caveats (And their current status in the implementation):

    TODO    1! Use an MDB_env* in the process which opened it, without fork()ing.
    DONE    2! Do not have open an LMDB database twice in the same process at the same time. Not even from a plain open() call - close()ing it breaks
               flock()  advisory locking.
    SEE 6.  3! Avoid long-lived transactions. Read transactions prevent reuse of pages freed by newer write transactions, thus the database can grow
               quickly. Write transactions prevent other write transactions, since writes are serialized.
    SEE 6.  4! Avoid suspending a process with active transactions. These would then be "long-lived" as above. Also read transactions suspended when
               writers commit could sometimes see wrong data.
